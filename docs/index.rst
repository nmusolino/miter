Miter Package Documentation
===========================

The ``miter`` package provides utility functions for iterables and sequences in Python,
with an emphasis on performance.  Core functionality is implemented in C or C++ within
extension modules.

The ``miter`` package was inspired by the
`toolz <https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ package and by the
`itertools <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html>`__ module in the standard library.
